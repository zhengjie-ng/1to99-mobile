# 1to99

A real-time multiplayer number guessing game mobile application built with React Native and Expo.

## üéÆ Game Description

1to99 is a competitive multiplayer guessing game where players take turns trying to avoid guessing a secret number between 1 and 99. The game provides feedback to narrow down the range with each guess. The objective is to force other players to guess the secret number - whoever guesses the exact secret number loses the game! This mobile app provides an intuitive interface for creating rooms, joining games, and playing with friends in real-time.

## üì° WebSocket Implementation

### What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP request-response patterns, WebSockets allow both the client and server to send data at any time, making them perfect for real-time applications like games, chat systems, and live updates.

### How This Project Uses WebSockets

This mobile frontend communicates with the backend using **STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)** over WebSockets:

#### 1. WebSocket Service (`services/WebSocketService.js`)

The app uses a centralized WebSocket service that handles:

```javascript
// Connection establishment with SockJS fallback
this.client = new Client({
  webSocketFactory: () => new SockJS(this.wsUrl),
  reconnectDelay: 5000,
  heartbeatIncoming: 10000,
  heartbeatOutgoing: 10000,
  // Connection handlers...
});
```

**Key Features:**

- **SockJS Transport**: Provides WebSocket with fallback support for older browsers/environments
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatically reconnects if connection is lost
- **Heartbeat**: Maintains connection health with ping/pong messages
- **Subscription Management**: Tracks and manages topic subscriptions

#### 2. Game Context Integration (`context/GameContext.js`)

The WebSocket service is integrated into React's Context API for state management:

```javascript
// Connection setup
await WebSocketService.connect();
WebSocketService.subscribe("/user/queue/gameUpdate", handleGameUpdate);
WebSocketService.subscribe("/topic/gameResponse", handleGameUpdate);
```

**Message Handling:**

- **Room Creation**: Subscribes to user-specific topics for room creation responses
- **Game Updates**: Receives real-time game state changes
- **Player Actions**: Handles join/leave notifications
- **Error Handling**: Manages connection errors and game exceptions

#### 3. Frontend-Backend Communication Flow

**Connection Process:**

1. App launches ‚Üí WebSocket service connects to backend `/ws` endpoint
2. Service subscribes to general topics for initial communication
3. User actions trigger specific subscriptions (room topics, user topics)

**Message Exchange Examples:**

**Creating a Room:**

```javascript
// Frontend sends
WebSocketService.send("/app/createRoom", {
  playerName: "Player1",
  tempPlayerId: "temp_12345",
});

// Backend responds via: /topic/user.temp_12345
// Frontend receives: { type: "ROOM_CREATED", gameRoom: {...} }
```

**Making a Guess:**

```javascript
// Frontend sends
WebSocketService.send("/app/makeGuess", {
  roomId: "ROOM123",
  guess: 50,
});

// Backend broadcasts to: /topic/room.ROOM123
// All players receive: { type: "GUESS_MADE", lastTurn: {...} }
```

#### 4. Real-time Features Enabled by WebSockets

- **Instant Game Updates**: All players see moves immediately
- **Live Player Management**: Real-time join/leave notifications
- **Synchronized Game State**: Countdown timers, turn indicators, range updates
- **Host Controls**: Real-time player removal and game restart
- **Connection Status**: Live connection health indicators

### Message Topics Structure

The app subscribes to different WebSocket topics based on context:

- **`/topic/room.{roomId}`** - Room-specific updates (all players)
- **`/topic/user.{playerId}`** - Personal messages (individual player)
- **`/user/queue/gameUpdate`** - Personal queue for direct messages
- **`/topic/gameResponse`** - General game responses

This multi-topic approach ensures players receive relevant updates while maintaining efficient message routing.
